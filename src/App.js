          <h2>Great IPA</h2>

          <p>
            Some hops is plowed. An often hairy girl scout thoroughly makes
            a pact with the Honey Brown over the Budweiser. A blood clot
            makes a pact with the discusting satelliste brewery. A lover about
            the Pilsner Urquell takes a peek at the bottle of beer. The coors
            light,the crank case of an IPA, and a Citra Ninja are what made
            America great!

          <h2>Buzz</h2>

          <p>

            The earthy and floral aromas from the hops can be overpowering. Drop

            a little Cascade in at the end of the boil to lift the profile with

            a bit of citrus.

          <h2>Trashy Blond</h2>

          <p>

            Be careful not to collect too much wort from the mash. Once the

            sugars are all washed out there are some very unpleasant grainy

            tasting compounds that can be extracted into the wort.

          <h2>Berliner Weisse With Yuzu - B-Sides</h2>

          <p>

            Clean everything twice. All you want is the clean sourness of

            lactobacillus.

          <h2>Pilsen Lager</h2>

          <p>

            Play around with the fermentation temperature to get the best

            flavour profile from the individual yeasts.

          <h2>Avery Brown Dredge</h2>

          <p>

            Make sure you have a big enough yeast starter to ferment through the

            OG and lager successfully.

          <h2>Electric India</h2>

          <p>

            Source some really good heather honey to get the right spicy esters

            in the beer.

          <h2>AB:12</h2>

          <p>

            Don't worry too much about controlling the temperature with the

            Belgian yeast strain - just make sure it doesn't rise above 30Â°C!

          <h2>Fake Lager</h2>

          <p>

            Once the primary fermentation is complete get this beer as cold as

            you can and let it mature for as long as you've got.

          <h2>AB:07</h2>

          <p>

            Authentic heather honey adds a beautiful floral top note that is

            unachievable any other way.

          </p>

          <h2>Bramling X</h2>

          <p>

            Getting good Bramling Cross is key. Most English hops are in leaf

            form (not pelletised), so getting fresh hops close to harvest

            (September) will give this beer the right amount of dark berry

            intensity.
